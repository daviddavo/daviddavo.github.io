summary: >
  Research assistant that just finished its Master's in Artificial Intelligence at the Politechnic University of Madrid.
  **Currently I am searching for opportunities to finance a PhD**.


  While I studied things more related to theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence, I also like hardware and computer architecture. I am
  a software libre, hacking and computer history enthusiast. 
  My previous publications are related to Human-Computer Interaction, but I am eager to learn new things.
  

  In my free time, I have a small homelab and [study Japanese](/jp), and I also have a [blog](https://blog.ddavo.me).
