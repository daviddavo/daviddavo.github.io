# a summary about you
summary: >
  Research Engineer @ [BSC](https://bsc.es) and **part-time PhD student in Computer Architecture** @ [UPC](https://www.upc.edu/en), reasearching matrix multiplication acceleration.
  Previously, I worked at the GRASIA research group in the Complutense University of Madrid, researching how people use computers to collaborate.


  Finished a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the Politechnic University of Madrid in 2024 and inmediately
  started doing a PhD in Computer Science at the Complutense University of Madrid. Although I received the
  prestigious FPU scholarship from the Spanish Ministry of Science, I rejected it to go play with hardware and optimization,
  one of my then hobbies, and now passions.


  In my free time, I have a small homelab, read about computer history, [study Japanese](/jp), and I also have a [blog](https://blog.ddavo.me).
