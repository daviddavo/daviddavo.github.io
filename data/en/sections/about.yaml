summary: >
  I am a Computer Science student that just finished its Bachelor's degree at [Complutense University of Madrid](https://www.ucm.es/english).
  Currently I am pursuing a [Master's Dregree on Artificial Intelligence](http://www.dia.fi.upm.es/masteria/?q=en) at the [Politechnic University of Madrid](https://www.upm.es/internacional).


  While I studied things more related to theoretical computer science, I also like hardware and computer architecture. I am
  a software libre, hacking and computer history enthusiast.
  

  In my free time, I have a small homelab and study Japanese, and I also have a [blog](https://blog.ddavo.me).
